2.	Цензура
3.	Нагрузка (100000 токенов) – тут есть вопросы к поставщикам по производительности
4.	Финансовый домен (Сбер хорошо отрабатывает)
5.	Навыки (задачи извлечения из текстовой новости, временные атрибуты – пока ещё плохо отрабатываются)
2.	Есть интерес посмотреть решение по ген коду Kodify – презентацию прилагаю
Внутренний контур:
1.	Есть так же запрет по использованию Llama, можем ещё раз обсудить после закупки оборудования, возможно для контурного развертывания ограничения ослабит комплаенс
2.	Планируется закупка H100
3.	Будет тестирование ПАК GigaCube
